to detect real time vedio from your webcam and using mediapipe

a tool in opencv plots a layout of your body and tracks your movements

while the camera is capturing vedio it notices your movements and tracks 

your positions and as soon as your sholders get down from your elbows it 

marks your position as down and when you get up it marks the position as

up and increases the pushup count by one and resets the position now 

similar positions are tracked for situps left kicks and right kicks
